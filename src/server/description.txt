[DESCRIPTION]

/psensor-server is a/

It provides a JSON Web service which can be used by psensor(1) to
monitor remotely the hardware sensors of a computer.

It can provide information about:
  * the temperature of the motherboard and CPU sensors (using lm\-sensors).
  * the temperature of the Hard Disk Drives (using hddtemp).
  * the rotation speed of the fans (using lm\-sensors).

The entry point of the JSON Web service is:
http://hostname:3131/api/1.0/sensors.

It is also possible to connect to the psensor\-server with a browser, a
simple Web page is displaying the sensors information and the CPU
usage.

If run in debug mode, psensor\-server can be stopped by sending an HTTP
request with the URL 'http://hostname:port/api/1.0/server/stop'.

[WARNING]

psensor\-server does not provide any way to restrict the connection to
the HTTP server, worst, no effort has been made against malicious HTTP
attacks.  You should make the psensor\-server port available only to a
network or computer you trust by using the usual network security
tools of the system (for example, iptables(8) ).
